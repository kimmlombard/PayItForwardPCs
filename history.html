    <h1>Our History</h1>
    <p>The journey of Pay It Forward PCs has been one of persistence and dedication to doing things the right way.</p>

    <div class="milestone">
        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <p>
            We initially began our operations organized as an LLC. However, realizing that our mission was truly charitable,
            we embarked on the complex process of converting to a full non-profit entity to better serve our community.

    <div class="milestone">
        <h3>Becoming a 501(c)(3)</h3>
        <p>
            Working closely with <strong>BryteBridge Consulting</strong>, we navigated the dissolution of our LLC status
            and filed for federal non-profit recognition. This transition was critical to ensuring transparency and maximizing the impact of every donation.
        </p>

    <div class="milestone">
        <h3>Official Recognition</h3>
        <p>
            In July 2023, we received what we call our "miracle"—official <strong>State Charity Registration</strong> from the State of California.
            This approval allowed us to finalize our non-profit accounts with major partners like Amazon, solidifying our ability to source high-quality equipment for those in need.
